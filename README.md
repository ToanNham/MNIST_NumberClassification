MNIST NumberClassification

Description: This small project a practice and introductory project to machine learning. Using the MNIST database, we trained a CNN model to categorize hand-written numbers. The file ModelTrainer.py will load the dataset, train the model, then save it into a model.bin file. File ModelTester.py can be used to test the model's accuracy. At the current state, the model achieved the accuracy of 99.8% in training and 98.8% in testing. 

Instructions:
1. Install python 3.10 (or above)
2. Install the required modules with pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run file ModelTrainer.py
4. Run file ModelTester.py
