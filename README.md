MNIST NumberClassification

Description: The project is a beginner-level machine learning project that uses the MNIST database to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to categorize handwritten numbers. The ModelTrainer.py file loads the dataset, trains the model, and saves it as a model.bin file. The model's accuracy currently stands at 99.8% in training and 98.8% in testing.

Instructions:
1. Install python 3.10 (or above)
2. Install the required modules with pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run file ModelTrainer.py to train the model
4. Run file ModelTester.py to test the model
